	<P style= "font-family: comic sans MS; color:#1520A6; align: justify">Acids are substances that taste sour and can turn blue litmus paper red. They are found in many everyday items, from lemons (citric acid) to vinegar (acetic acid).</P>
	
<H2>Types of acid</H2>
<P style= "font-family: comic sans MS; color:#1520A6; align: justify">Natural Acids: These are found in nature, like the citric acid in citrus fruits and the lactic acid in sour milk.

Mineral Acids: These are man-made and often stronger, like hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), which are used in laboratories and industries.

Acids have a pH less than 7 and can react with metals, bases, and carbonates. They are an important part of many chemical reactions and processes.

<H2>Weak acids</H2>
<P style= "font-family: comic sans MS; color:#1520A6; align: justify">Weak acids are acids that partially dissociate into their ions in water. Unlike strong acids, they do not completely ionize, which means they release fewer hydrogen ions (H⁺) into the solution. This results in a higher pH compared to strong acids.Weak acids are less aggressive in their behavior compared to strong acids.
When weak acids dissolve in water, they don't release all their hydrogen ions. This partial dissociation is why their solutions are not as strongly acidic.

<H2>Strong acids</H2>
<P style= "font-family: comic sans MS; color:#1520A6; align: justify">IN PARA
Strong acids are substances that fully dissociate into ions in water, releasing all their hydrogen ions (H⁺), which makes their solutions very acidic. They have a pH close to 0, indicating a high level of acidity. Some common examples of strong acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), and nitric acid (HNO₃). These acids are highly corrosive and can cause severe burns, so they must be handled with care, wearing protective gear like gloves and goggles. Strong acids are used extensively in industries for manufacturing fertilizers, refining oil, and producing chemicals, as well as in laboratories for various experiments. They also play a role in everyday products, such as car batteries (which use sulfuric acid) and the stomach's digestive process (which involves hydrochloric acid). Despite their strength, it's important to neutralize any spills with a weak base like baking soda before cleaning up, to ensure safety. Understanding strong acids and their properties is crucial for their safe and effective use in both industrial and laboratory settings.

<H2>Bases</H2>
<P style= "font-family: comic sans MS; color:#1520A6; align: justify">Bases are substances that can accept hydrogen ions (H⁺) or, more broadly, donate pairs of electrons. They tend to have a bitter taste and a slippery feel. Bases can be found in many everyday items, such as baking soda and soap.
